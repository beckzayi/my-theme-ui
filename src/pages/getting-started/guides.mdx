# Developer Guides

Our many customers all use our API for different purposes. API access is included on all plans at no charge because we believe that you are the owner of your data and you should never feel like your data is “locked up”.

However, because the API means there is little or no user-interaction, it can be very easy to create a program or routine that causes an unnecessarily high burden on our system. Even small accounts can generate huge numbers of expensive API requests by accident.

```
